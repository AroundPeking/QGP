#: description: Centrality dependence of the $D^0$ $p_{\rm T}$ differential invariant yield in Au+Au collisions (solid symbols). The curves are number-of-binary-collision-scaled Levy functions from fitting to the p+p result (open circles), which has been updated with the latest global analysis of charm fragmentation ratios from Ref and also taking into account the $p_{\rm T}$ dependence of the fragmentation ratio between $D^0$ and $D^{*{\pm}}$ from PYTHIA 6.4. The arrow denotes the upper limit with 90% confidence level of the last data point for 10$-$40% collisions. The systematic uncertainties are shown as square brackets.
