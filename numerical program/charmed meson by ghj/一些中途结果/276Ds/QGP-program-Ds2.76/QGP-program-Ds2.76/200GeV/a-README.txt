There are calculating results of three charmed mesons
(J/psi, D^0, D_s),
including final .dat files, some intermediate tests files,
and final plot .png.
All is fixed at 200 GeV in Au+Au collision(RHIC STAR).
This is to repeat the work in RM framework. 
Then we will reproduce results at 2.76/5.02 TeV in Pb+Pb collision(LHC ALICE).
