This is my undergraduate scientific training in the Physics Department of Sichuan University, where I had the opportunity to work alongside my classmates and roommates. I am grateful for the guidance and advice provided by Lilin Zhu (SCU) and Hua Zheng (SNNU) during this training period.



Finally, I would like to express my gratitude sincerely to my advisors Lilin Zhu, Hua Zheng, and my partners Tingjun Chen, Guiqi Liu, and Zhizhen Ye. I truly cherish and will always look back with nostalgia on the days we spent together during our scientific training in SCU.
