#: description: Inclusive J/$\psi$ yields in $p_{\rm T}$ intervals for the 0-20%, 20-40% and 40-90% most central Pb-Pb collisions. The rapidity range is $2.5<y<4$. Statistical and systematic uncertainties are also reported. A global systematic uncertainty of 4% affects all the values. A 2%, 1% and 2% systematic uncertainty, independent of $p_{\rm T}$, affects the centrality classes 0-20%, 20-40% and 40-90%, respectively.,,,,,,
